# 2.Hospital and Patient Data Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
# Overview
This project analyzes hospital and patient data to uncover insights on admissions, treatment outcomes, and patient demographics. Using Power BI, I created two interactive dashboards — one providing a general hospital overview and another focused on patient-level analysis.
The goal is to help healthcare management teams make data-driven decisions to improve operational efficiency, patient care, and resource allocation.
